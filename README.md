# REDACTr

This is a very simple application that helps users safely share text content on social media by conveniently changing portions of a message a user doesn't want to be made publicly available to other users.

The application can be easily accessed [here](https://altschool-hackathon.github.io/project-2/).

## Overview

This project was created as a submission for entry in Altschool Africa's [School of Engineering's](https://altschoolafrica.com/schools/engineering) summer hackathon. Below is a quoted description of the project requirements.

>## 02- Redactr - Scramble some words from a body of text content

>### Scenario

>Your app is to help people safely share content on social media by scrambling portions of the text they don’t want the world to read/see. A user will write/paste the some content into a form field and then specify the words they need to be scrambled (using another field). Note the user is allowed to specify more than one word (separated by space) to be scrambled.

>### Outcome

>After clicking a **“Redact Now”** button, the app scans through the original text and replaces the specified words to be scrambled with asterisks (i.e ***)
>
>### Advanced features (OPTIONAL- build any, some or all if you feel up to it)
>
>1. Allow the user specify what to use in replacing the words, so that the app can do the scrambling with what the user provides, be it asterisks, questions marks, dashes, underscores, or even other words.
>
>2. Display some stats like how many words were scanned, how many matched the words to be scrambled, how many characters were scrambled in total, how long it took (in seconds) to complete the scrambling task e.t.c. Feel free to be creative here.

- By default, if you do not want to input any words to replace the original word to be scrambled, it will be repalced by asterisks.

- Now, you can hit the 'redact now' and see the new text with the scrambled word available for you to use. You can also see some statistics regarding the words scanned, how many words were scrambled, and hwo long it took.
